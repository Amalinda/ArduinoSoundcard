This is a proof concept implementation of an audio interface using the Arduino.

The sound output is of cause not the best but could in principle be approved.

The program sending the audio to the Arduino is written in C++ using Qt
and a Qt serial communication library.

Since it is proof of concept the code is on some places a bit dirty :)
